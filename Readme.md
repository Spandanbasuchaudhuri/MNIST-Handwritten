# MNIST Digit Classifier

This project focuses on building and training a model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves high accuracy by implementing various machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Project Title:** MNIST Digit Classifier
- **Dataset:** [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- **Model Accuracy:** 97.72%
- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies handwritten digits.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run this project:

- `Python 3.x`
- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch`
- `Keras` (if using TensorFlow)
- `Scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn
```

## Model Overview

- **Model Architecture:**
  - Input Layer: 784 nodes (28x28 image pixels)
  - Hidden Layers: Fully connected layers with activation functions
  - Output Layer: 10 nodes, representing digits from 0 to 9
  - Activation Function: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
  - Output Activation: Softmax for multi-class classification

- **Training:**
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
  - Metrics: Accuracy
  - Number of Epochs: 10
  - Batch Size: 128

## Usage

To run the notebook and train the model:

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab and run all the cells to train the model.
4. The model will output accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix to evaluate performance.

## Results

- **Accuracy:** The model achieved an accuracy of **97.72%** on the test dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix:** The confusion matrix visualizes the performance of the classifier for each digit class.

## Conclusion

This MNIST digit classifier is an efficient model with high accuracy. It can be further improved by experimenting with different architectures, optimizers, or hyperparameter tuning.
